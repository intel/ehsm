 * depending on the android platform and ndk versions used, it may or may
 * not be defined in libc.so. In the latter case, we fail to link. Defining
 * it here as weak makes us provide the symbol when it's not provided by
 * the crt objects, making the change transparent for future NDKs that
 * would fix the original problem. On older NDKs, it is not a problem
 * either because the way __dso_handle was used was already broken (and
 * the custom linker works around it).
